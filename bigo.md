To calculate the Big O notation of an algorithm, you need to analyze the algorithm's performance as the input size grows. Big O notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity or space complexity. Here are the general steps to calculate the Big O notation:

1. Identify the dominant operations: Identify the key operations in your algorithm that contribute the most to its time complexity. Focus on the operations that scale with the input size.

2. Express the growth rate in terms of the input size: Determine how the number of operations or the space required by the algorithm grows as a function of the input size. Ignore constant factors and lower-order terms, focusing only on the most significant factors.

3. Remove coefficients and lower-order terms: Simplify the expression by removing any coefficients and lower-order terms, as Big O notation focuses on the dominant term that affects the algorithm's growth rate.

4. Determine the Big O notation: Based on the simplified expression, determine the appropriate Big O notation that represents the upper bound of the algorithm's time complexity or space complexity. Common notations include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), etc.

Here are some examples to illustrate the process:

Example 1: Linear Search
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for element in arr:
        if element == target:
            return True
    return False
```
- The dominant operation is the loop that iterates through the input array.
- The loop iterates once for each element in the array, resulting in O(n) time complexity, where n is the input size.
- The Big O notation for linear search is O(n).

Example 2: Bubble Sort
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```
- The dominant operations are the nested loops that iterate through the input array.
- The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs n - i - 1 times for each iteration of the outer loop.
- Simplifying the expression, we get O(n^2) time complexity.
- The Big O notation for bubble sort is O(n^2).

It's important to note that Big O notation represents the worst-case scenario or the upper bound of the algorithm's complexity. It provides a way to compare the scalability and efficiency of algorithms without considering specific constant factors or input variations.
